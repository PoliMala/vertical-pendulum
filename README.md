# Vertical Pendulum - Proportional Control

This repository contains analytic evaluations and numerical simulations for the problem of one or more vertical pendulus. A proportional control is formulated such that the vertical equilibrium results locally stable.

Problem formulation and analytic solution are contained in the notebooks.
