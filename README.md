# Vertical Pendulum - Proportional Control

This repository contains analytic evaluations and numerical simulations for the problem of one or more vertical pendulus. A proportional control is formulated such that the vertical equilibrium results locally stable.

Problem formulation and analytic solution are contained in the Mathematica notebooks (./notebooks/). They contain an explanation of the equation derivation usefull for an understandin of the model.

The aim of the code is that of analyse the Basis Of Attraction (BOA) of the stabilized vertical rod equilibrium.
